Study of the extinction in the epidemic SIRS Model using Machine Learning
The following GitHub repository contains all the important codes used in the study of the extinction in the epidemic SIRS model 
using differential equations. The data analysis using machine learning is also in the repository, where you can examine the algorithms used and try to reproduce the data. All the data that resulted from the simulations using diferential equations are stored in the repository "Data". If you have any questions about this study, please send an e-mail to germanohartmannbrill@gmail.com.
